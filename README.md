# React + Vite

# WTWR

Weather App representing different clothing options and suggestions based on location and weather condition.

This is the fourth project of the Software Engineering Program with TripleTen. This porject incoporates React and Vite.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Plans to Imporve the Project:

Incorporate form validation and responsive design.
Add key listener for Modal and ability to exit modal by clicking outside of modal.
